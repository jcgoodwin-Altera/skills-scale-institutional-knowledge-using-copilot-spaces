# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation. This repository contains comprehensive guides and processes for managing projects at OctoAcme.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes are designed to foster consistency, clarity, and collaboration across cross-functional teams. Initiatives begin with a structured project initiation phase, where each new project is documented through a concise one-pager capturing the problem statement, goals, key stakeholders, success metrics, milestones, risks, and resource estimates. This early emphasis on alignment ensures all parties share a common understanding of the project's intent and priorities before moving to in-depth planning.

In the planning stage, projects are broken down into actionable increments. Teams conduct a kickoff meeting, prioritize backlog items with acceptance criteria, estimate scope, and clearly define the Definition of Done (DoD). Backlogs, risk registers, and release plans provide the scaffolding for successful delivery. Milestones and dependencies are mapped out, ensuring both transparency and accountability, while risk and dependency management is actively tracked throughout every phase.

Roles and communication are explicitly defined to safeguard smooth progress. Project Managers are responsible for coordination, scheduling, risk, and communication, while Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize features. Developers focus on building, testing, and collaborating, and QA ensures release quality. These roles interact through a cadence of daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, regular stakeholder updates, and strategic retrospectives. Key workflows use structured tools like project boards, detailed PR processes (small, reviewed, and tested PRs), and risk escalation paths from the team level up to project sponsors.

Quality assurance is integrated throughout execution and release. Automated and manual testing, security checks, and documented deployment playbooks all reduce risk at every turn. Continuous improvement is promoted via structured retrospectives after each release or milestone—tracking action items, celebrating wins, and iteratively refining processes. This holistic approach—covering strategic planning, risk management, clear communication channels, and robust quality practices—makes OctoAcme's project management approach both repeatable and adaptable, supporting sustainable delivery and team growth.
